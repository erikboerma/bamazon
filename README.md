# bamazon

Created a database that shows you current inventory/prices/quantity and gives you the option to purchase any item.  If the desired quantity is above inventory, it will reject the purchase and bring you back to the start.  If enough inventory is available, it will purchase the item, update the database and ask if you'd like to make another purchase.
